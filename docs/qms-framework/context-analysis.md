=== ":material-lightning-bolt: Quick (~1h)"

    **ISO 9001 Clause 4.1** | **Owner:** Unit Lead

    ## Key Takeaways

    - **Strengths:** Deep AD/ADAS expertise, strong DevOps culture, cloud-native architecture
    - **Weaknesses:** Rapid growth causing knowledge silos, technical debt, limited formal QMS docs
    - **Opportunities:** Growing AD market, data-driven development trend, cloud innovation
    - **Threats:** Evolving regulations (EU AI Act), cloud cost inflation, talent competition

    > If asked: "We conduct quarterly context reviews as part of management review. External issues tracked via regulatory watch; internal issues surface through retrospectives and team health checks."
