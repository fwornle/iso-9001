| S4 | Cloud-native architecture (Infrastructure-as-Code) | Supports reproducibility, auditability, scalability |
| S5 | Embedded in BMW Group ecosystem | Access to shared platforms, standards, and support functions |
| S6 | *[Add your own]* | |

### Weaknesses (Internal, Negative)

| # | Weakness | Impact on QMS | Mitigation |
|---|----------|---------------|------------|
| W1 | Rapid team growth → knowledge silos | Risk of inconsistent practices | Structured onboarding, documentation, pairing |
| W2 | Technical debt in legacy components | Impacts reliability and maintainability | Dedicated tech debt sprints, refactoring OKRs |
| W3 | Limited formal QMS documentation to date | Gap for audit readiness | This initiative — establishing QMS documentation |
| W4 | Dependency on key individuals for critical systems | Bus factor risk | Cross-training, documentation, runbooks |
| W5 | *[Add your own]* | | |

### Opportunities (External, Positive)

| # | Opportunity | Potential Benefit |
|---|-------------|-------------------|
| O1 | Growing AD/ADAS market and regulatory push for validation | Increased demand for our tooling services |
| O2 | Industry shift to data-driven development | Positions our unit as strategic enabler |
| O3 | Cloud provider innovation (GPU instances, managed ML services) | Can improve tool performance and reduce costs |
| O4 | Open-source ecosystem growth in AD (ROS2, OpenAD Kit) | Leverage community tools, reduce development effort |
| O5 | *[Add your own]* | |

### Opportunities (External, Negative → Threats)

| # | Threat | Potential Impact | Mitigation |
|---|--------|------------------|------------|
| T1 | Evolving regulatory landscape (EU AI Act, UN R157) | May require tool re-qualification | Regulatory watch, proactive compliance |
| T2 | Cloud cost inflation | Budget pressure | FinOps practices, cost optimization |
| T3 | Cybersecurity threats to data infrastructure | Data integrity/availability risk | Security hardening, penetration testing |
| T4 | Talent competition in AD/ML space | Difficulty retaining skilled engineers | Competitive compensation, interesting work, learning culture |
| T5 | Sensor technology changes requiring pipeline redesign | Rework of data ingestion/processing | Modular architecture, abstraction layers |
| T6 | *[Add your own]* | | |
